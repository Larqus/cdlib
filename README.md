This is based on https://github.com/xxx/cdlib, but that repo was missing the
/config and /d directory trees, which are necessary to have a working MUD.

Those directories have been rebuilt based on a *really* old (~1995) backup
I had of the cdlib mudlib and a slightly-newer (but modified) working MUD
backup.

I've tried to minimize any changes to try and keep this as faithful to the
original as I can, limiting changes to things required to make it work,
particularly with the current CD driver (06.04), from
https://github.com/cotillion/cd-gamedriver
