The /std/map and /std/mapsquare stuff still doesn't work
 - missing defines for OUT_NORTH -type directions (seems to want inverse
   bitmaps of the defined (in config/sys/map_directions.h) NORTH,EAST,etc
 - missing define for INVERTED_EXITS.  Would this be an OR of all fo the
   OUT_* ones? -- wouldn't that just be an all-ones bitmap?
 - mapsquare is looking for /sys/map.h, which I don't have a copy of

The /d/Standard/login (new player creation) needs to be completely
reworked.  It's functional, but I had to read the code in order to figure
out how to get past it (guess-the-verb issues)
